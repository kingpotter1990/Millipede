    abstract = {Segmented myriapod-like bodies may offer performance benefits over more common fixed body morphologies for ambulation.
    Here, the design of a segmented ambulatory microrobot with a flexible backbone is presented. A dynamic model describing the motion of the microrobot is used to determine body parameters. A three-segment microrobot was fabricated using the Smart Composite Microstructures process and piezoelectric bimorph actuators, and forward locomotion on a flat surface was demonstrated. The footprint of the 750 mg microrobot is 3.5 by 3.5 cm, and it has potential advantages over rigid body hexapedal microrobots in climbing, versatility, and stability.},

Pairs of individuals enter one-on-one contests in which they contend to gain control of a common resource. The winners receive higher relative fitness scores allowing them to survive and reproduce. Realistic dynamics simulation including gravity, collisions, and friction, restricts the actions to physically plausible behaviors. The morphology of these creatures and the neural systems for controlling their muscle forces are both genetically determined, and the morphology and behavior can adapt to each other as they evolve simultaneously. The genotypes are structured as directed graphs of nodes and connections, and they can efficiently but flexibly describe instructions for the development of creatures' bodies and control systems with repeating or recursive components. When simulated evolutions are performed with populations of competing creatures, interesting and diverse strategies and counter-strategies emerge.}},

@inproceedings{bigdog,
    abstract = {{Less than half the Earth's landmass is accessible to existing wheeled and tracked vehicles. But people and animals using their legs can go almost anywhere on Earth. Our mission at Boston Dynamics is to develop a new breed of rough-terrain robots that capture the mobility, autonomy and speed of living creatures. Such robots will travel in outdoor terrain that is too steep, rutted, rocky, wet, muddy, and snowy for conventional vehicles. They will also travel in cities and in our homes, doing chores and providing care, where steps, stairways and household clutter limit the utility of wheeled vehicles. Robots meeting these goals will have terrain sensors, sophisticated computing and power systems, advanced actuators and dynamic controls. I will give a status report on BigDog, an example of such rough-terrain robots. It is a 100 kg quadruped robot that balances actively as it operates on a variety of outdoor terrains, carries a 65 kg load, runs travels at up to 11 kph.}},
