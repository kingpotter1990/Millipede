Things to work on

1. Invertible Implict Elasticity (not likely)
2. Turning (Done)
3. Terrain (Done)
4. Antenna (In Progress)
- Obstacle
- Food
1.22 - 1.30

5. Construct different Terrains, experiment
- cylinders paved road
- spheres paved road
- Cubes paved road
- Closed Room
- Maze for Food
2.1 - 2.30

6. Build different Body Types, experiment
- Multipede Robot
- Millipede
- Centipede
3.1 - 3.30

7. Try Let the millipede walk on walls, from ground to wall
optional

8. Rendering
4.1 - 4.30

9. Polishing of Paper
4.1 - 4.30


Current Issues:
1. Body not serpentine enough, body line not smooth enough, section bumping all time [Solved By letting body section in supported
mode when one leg is in stance mode, also by updating the keep section balanced code]
2. Legs not in wave pattern, no consideration for collision of legs, etc
[Plan to solve by applying leg relative rotation diff constraint]
[Partially Solved]
3. Terrain GetNormal FUnction seems wrong, generate Normal Function most likely wrong
